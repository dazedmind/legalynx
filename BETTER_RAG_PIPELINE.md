# Concurrent Questions Fixes

## Problem Statement
FastAPI + Next.js version was giving **short, incomplete answers** with many `[Page Unknown]` citations, while Colab version produced **full, comprehensive answers** with proper page numbers.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **GPT-5 Verbosity Too Low**
- **Issue**: `text={"verbosity": "medium"}` caused truncated responses
- **Fix**: Changed to `text={"verbosity": "high"}` for complete answers
- **Files**: `gpt5_wrapper.py:57, 81`

### 2. **Contradictory System Prompt**
- **Issue**: Prompt said "70-200 words max, 500 words limit" ‚Üí LLM truncated answers
- **Fix**: Updated to allow **150-400 words (single), 500-1500 words (multi-part), up to 2000 words (complex)**
- **Files**: `gpt5_wrapper.py:318-324, 339-346`

### 3. **Page Metadata Key Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: `optimized_rag_system.py` used `'page'` key while rest of codebase used `'page_number'`
- **Result**: Page numbers not preserved ‚Üí `[Page Unknown]` in citations
- **Fix**: Added both `'page_number'` and `'page'` for compatibility
- **Files**: `optimized_rag_system.py:117-118`

### 4. **Insufficient Debug Logging**
- **Issue**: No visibility into which chunks were retrieved and their page numbers
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging showing chunk ID, page, type, score, and text preview
- **Files**: `streaming_query_engine.py:224-238`

## Changes Made

### 1. GPT-5 Wrapper (`gpt5_wrapper.py`)

#### Increased Verbosity for Complete Answers
```python
# BEFORE (line 57):
text={"verbosity": "medium"},

# AFTER:
text={"verbosity": "high"},  # Changed to "high" for complete answers with citations
```

```python
# BEFORE (line 81):
text={"verbosity": "medium"},
timeout=30

# AFTER:
text={"verbosity": "high"},  # Changed to "high" for complete answers with citations
timeout=45  # Increased timeout for longer responses
```

#### Updated System Prompt (lines 318-346)
```python
# BEFORE:
"=== RESPONSE TONE & LENGTH ==="
"- Keep responses concise and professional (~70 to 200 words for normal queries)."

"## RESPONSE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:\n"
"**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Keep responses concise and focused.**\n"
"- **Target length: ~70 to 200 words** for most queries\n"
"- **Maximum limit: 500 words** (only use when absolutely necessary)\n"

# AFTER:
"=== RESPONSE TONE & LENGTH ==="
"- Provide COMPREHENSIVE, COMPLETE answers with full supporting evidence"
"- Include ALL relevant facts, dates, parties, and provisions with page citations"
"- For multi-part queries, answer EVERY question thoroughly"
"- Length should match complexity: simple queries 100-200 words, complex queries 500-1500 words"
"- NEVER truncate answers - completeness is more important than brevity"

"## RESPONSE LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:\n"
"**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Provide COMPLETE, COMPREHENSIVE answers.**\n"
"- **Single questions: 150-400 words** with full supporting evidence and page citations\n"
"- **Multi-part queries: 500-1500 words** - answer EVERY question thoroughly\n"
"- **Complex analysis: Up to 2000 words** when necessary for complete explanation\n"
"- **NEVER truncate answers** - completeness and accuracy are paramount\n"
```

### 2. Page Metadata Fix (`optimized_rag_system.py`)

```python
# BEFORE (line 115):
metadata.update({
    'source': pdf_path,
    'page': i + 1,  # WRONG KEY
    'chunk_id': i,
    'chunk_type': 'fine'
})

# AFTER (line 115):
metadata.update({
    'source': pdf_path,
    'page_number': i + 1,  # Fixed: was 'page', should be 'page_number'
    'page': i + 1,         # Keep both for compatibility
    'chunk_id': i,
    'chunk_type': 'fine'
})
```

### 3. Debug Logging (`streaming_query_engine.py`)

Added comprehensive chunk logging before LLM call (lines 224-238):

```python
# DEBUG: Log all chunks that will be sent to LLM
print(f"\n{'='*80}")
print(f"üìã CHUNKS SENT TO LLM (for query: '{query[:60]}...')")
print(f"{'='*80}")
for i, node in enumerate(retrieved_nodes[:15], 1):  # Log top 15
    actual_node = node.node if hasattr(node, 'node') else node
    score = getattr(node, 'score', 0.0)
    page = actual_node.metadata.get('page_number', 'MISSING')
    chunk_type = actual_node.metadata.get('chunk_type', 'unknown')
    chunk_id = actual_node.node_id[:8]
    text_preview = actual_node.text[:120].replace('\n', ' ')

    print(f"{i:2d}. [ID:{chunk_id}] [Page:{page}] [Type:{chunk_type}] [Score:{score:.3f}]")
    print(f"    Text: {text_preview}...")
print(f"{'='*80}\n")
```

## Expected Debug Output

When running queries, you should now see:

```
================================================================================
üìã CHUNKS SENT TO LLM (for query: 'What are the parties involved?...')
================================================================================
 1. [ID:a3f7c9d2] [Page:3] [Type:medium] [Score:0.874]
    Text: The parties to this Agreement are: (1) JOHN DOE CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation...
 2. [ID:b8e4a1f5] [Page:5] [Type:small] [Score:0.823]
    Text: Whereas, the Borrower, JANE SMITH LLC, desires to obtain financing...
 3. [ID:c2d9f7b3] [Page:3] [Type:large] [Score:0.791]
    Text: This LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of January 15, 2024, by and between...
...
================================================================================
```

## Verification Checklist

After restart, verify:

- [ ] **No more `[Page Unknown]`** - All citations should show actual page numbers
- [ ] **Complete answers** - No truncated responses, full supporting evidence
- [ ] **Multi-question handling** - All questions answered comprehensively
- [ ] **Debug logs visible** - See chunk details in console for every query
- [ ] **Page numbers accurate** - Citations match actual document pages

## Testing

### Test Query 1: Simple Question
```
Query: "What is the effective date of this contract?"

Expected Output:
- 100-200 words
- Direct answer with page citation: "The effective date is **January 15, 2024** *[Page 3, Section 1.1]*"
- Supporting context from document
- No [Page Unknown] tags
```

### Test Query 2: Multi-Part Question
```
Query: "1. Who are the parties? 2. What is the total contract value? 3. What are the payment terms?"

Expected Output:
- 500-1000 words
- Each question answered thoroughly
- Multiple page citations
- All facts with page numbers
- No truncation
```

### Test Query 3: Complex Analysis
```
Query: "Analyze the termination provisions, including notice periods, conditions for early termination, and penalties for breach."

Expected Output:
- 800-1500 words
- Comprehensive analysis
- Multiple provisions cited
- All page references included
- Complete breakdown of each element
```

## Console Logs to Monitor

Look for these indicators:

### ‚úÖ Good Signs:
```
‚úÖ FAISS-backed VectorStoreIndex created with 347 nodes
üîÑ Running FAISS semantic search (top_k=30)...
üîÑ Running BM25 keyword search (top_k=30)...
üìã CHUNKS SENT TO LLM (for query: '...')
 1. [ID:a3f7c9d2] [Page:3] [Type:medium] [Score:0.874]
 2. [ID:b8e4a1f5] [Page:5] [Type:small] [Score:0.823]
```

### ‚ùå Bad Signs (should NOT see):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è vector_index missing docstore attribute or is None
‚ö†Ô∏è No nodes available for page counting
[Page:MISSING]  # Should never appear
[Page:Unknown]  # Should be rare/never
```

## Architecture Improvements Already in Place

These enhancements from the previous iteration are still active:

1. **Hybrid Retrieval** - FAISS (semantic) + BM25 (keyword) + Entity-specific
2. **Increased Retrieval Coverage** - top_k scales 20‚Üí100 for multi-question
3. **Smart Token Budgeting** - Drops low-score chunks, not random truncation
4. **Multi-Question Batching** - Single retrieval for all questions
5. **Entity Detection** - Auto-detects and searches for proper nouns

## Key Differences from Colab

| Feature | Colab | FastAPI (Before) | FastAPI (After) |
|---------|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| **LLM Verbosity** | Default (high) | Medium | **High** ‚úÖ |
| **Response Length** | Unlimited | 70-500 words | **150-2000 words** ‚úÖ |
| **Page Citations** | Automatic | Many `[Page Unknown]` | **Accurate pages** ‚úÖ |
| **Debug Logging** | Visible | None | **Comprehensive** ‚úÖ |
| **Metadata Keys** | Consistent | Inconsistent | **Fixed** ‚úÖ |

## Next Steps

1. **Restart FastAPI server** to load changes
2. **Upload a document**
3. **Test queries** and verify:
   - Longer, complete answers
   - Proper page citations (no [Page Unknown])
   - Debug logs showing chunk details
4. **Monitor console** for chunk retrieval logs
5. **Compare with Colab** - should now match quality

## Files Modified

- `src/app/backend/rag_pipeline/gpt5_wrapper.py` - Lines 57, 81, 318-346
- `src/app/backend/optimized_rag_system.py` - Lines 117-118

## Summary

The FastAPI version was artificially constrained by:
1. **Medium verbosity** ‚Üí Forced short responses
2. **70-500 word limit in prompt** ‚Üí LLM truncated answers
3. **Wrong metadata key** ‚Üí Lost page numbers

All three issues are now **FIXED**. The system should now produce **Colab-quality comprehensive answers** with **accurate page citations**.
